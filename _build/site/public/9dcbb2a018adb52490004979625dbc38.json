The forecasts consist of more than 50 chemical species (e.g. ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide) and seven different types of aerosol (desert dust, sea salt, organic matter, black carbon, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium aerosol). In addition, several meteorological variables are available as well.\nThe initial conditions of each forecast are obtained by combining a previous forecast with current satellite observations through a process called data assimilation. This best estimate of the state of the atmosphere at the initial forecast time step, called the analysis, provides a globally complete and consistent dataset allowing for estimates at locations where observation data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available.\nThe forecast itself uses a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry to determine the evolution of the concentrations of all species over time for the next five days. Apart from the required initial state, it also uses inventory-based or observation-based emission estimates as a boundary condition at the surface.\nThe CAMS global forecasting system is upgraded about once a year resulting in technical and scientific changes. The horizontal or vertical resolution can change, new species can be added, and more generally the accuracy of the forecasts can be improved. Details of these system changes can be found in the documentation. Users looking for a more consistent long-term data set should consider using the CAMS Global Reanalysis instead, which is available through the ADS and spans the period from 2003 onwards.\n Finally, because some meteorological fields in the forecast do not fall within the general CAMS data licence, they are only available with a delay of 5 days.","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2015-01-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST","keywords":["Aerosol","Analysis","Present","airPollution","Atmospheric conditions","Atmosphere (meteorology)","Global","Atmosphere (composition)","Forecast","Future","Past","Reactive gas"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/5cqpD","rel":"describedby","title":"CAMS Global atmospheric composition forecast data documentation"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/node/326","rel":"describedby","title":"Changes in CAMS global production system"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/node/325#fd66a9d3-e408-4b51-84c0-c2253a06f727","rel":"describedby","title":"Evaluation and quality assurance (EQA) reports"},{"href":"https://global-evaluation.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/","rel":"describedby","title":"Evaluation of global forecasts"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_atmosphere_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"CAMS global atmospheric composition forecasts","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/cams-global-emission-inventories/overview_def42da7bfd33d3f2cc49e07bc5cac39340cc56944bcbbd96d7f8117e5bd3756.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"dedl:short_description":"This data set contains gridded distributions of global anthropogenic and natural emissions.","description":"This data set contains gridded distributions of global anthropogenic and natural emissions.\nNatural and anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases are key drivers of the evolution of the composition of the atmosphere, so an accurate representation of them in forecast models of atmospheric composition is essential. CAMS compiles inventories of emission data that serve as input to its own forecast models, but which can also be used by other atmospheric chemical transport models. These inventories are based on a combination of existing data sets and new information, describing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel use on land, shipping, and aviation, and natural emissions from vegetation, soil, the ocean and termites. The anthropogenic emissions on land are further separated in specific activity sectors (e.g., power generation, road traffic, industry). The CAMS emission data sets provide good consistency between the emissions of greenhouse gases, reactive gases, and aerosol particles and their precursors. Because most inventory-based data sets are only available with a delay of several years, the CAMS emission inventories also extend these existing data sets forward in time by using the trends from the most recent available years, producing timely input data for real-time forecast models.\nMost of the data sets are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency, when needed. This is reflected by the different version numbers.","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2003-01-01T00:00:00Z","2020-12-31T23:59:59Z"]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_EMISSION_INVENTORIES","keywords":["Aerosol","Emissions and surface fluxes","airPollution","Atmospheric conditions","Global","Emission inventory","Past","Reactive gas"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/anthropogenic-and-natural-emissions","rel":"describedby","title":"CAMS anthropogenic and natural emissions documentation"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_EMISSION_INVENTORIES","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_EMISSION_INVENTORIES"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_EMISSION_INVENTORIES/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_atmosphere_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"CAMS global emission inventories","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/cams-global-fire-emissions-gfas/overview_eaf1132e6ada572e7ab38d00431929a48be55ac21bb5ec24bbe5d0c65be670ad.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"dedl:short_description":"This dataset provides geographical distributions of the radiative forcing (RF) by key atmospheric constituents.","description":"Emissions of atmospheric pollutants from biomass burning and vegetation fires are key drivers of the evolution of atmospheric composition, with a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, and an accurate representation of them in models is essential.\n\nThe CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) utilises satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) to provide near-real-time information on the location, relative intensity and estimated emissions from biomass burning and vegetation fires. Emissions are estimated by (i) conversion of FRP observations to the dry matter (DM) consumed by the fire, and (ii) application of emission factors to DM for different biomes, based on field and laboratory studies in the scientific literature, to estimate the emissions. Emissions estimates for 40 pyrogenic species are available from GFAS, including aerosols, reactive gases and greenhouse gases, on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees longitude by 0.1 degrees latitude.\n\nThis version of GFAS (v1.2) provides daily averaged data based on a combination of FRP observations from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, one on the NASA EOS-Terra satellite and the other on the NASA EOS-Aqua satellite from 1 January 2003 to present. GFAS also provides daily estimates of smoke plume injection heights derived from FRP observations and meteorological information from the operational weather forecasts from ECMWF.\n\nGFAS data have been used to provide surface boundary conditions for the CAMS global atmospheric composition and European regional air quality forecasts, and the wider atmospheric chemistry modelling community.\n\nMore details about the products are given in the Documentation section.\n\n## How to cite the CAMS GFAS data\n\nPlease acknowledge the use of the CAMS GFAS data as stated in the [Copernicus CAMS License agreement](http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/copernicus/):\n\tWhere the Licensee communicates to the public or distributes or publishes CAMS Information, the Licensee shall inform the recipients of the source of that information by using the following or any similar notice:\n'Generated using Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Information [Year]'.\n\tWhere the Licensee makes or contributes to a publication or distribution containing adapted or modified CAMS Information, the Licensee shall provide the following or any similar notice:\n'Contains modified Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Information [Year]';\n\nAny such publication or distribution shall state that \"neither the European Commission nor ECMWF is responsible for any use that may be made of the information it contains.\"","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2003-01-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS","keywords":["Aerosol","Emissions and surface fluxes","Analysis","Present","airPollution","Global","Atmospheric conditions","Past","Reactive gas"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/to1CBQ","rel":"describedby","title":"Documentation on the CAMS global fire assimilation system","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/16906-improving-gfas-and-cams-biomass-burning-estimations-means-global-ecmwf-fire-forecast-system.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Improving CAMS biomass burning estimations by means of the Global ECMWFFire Forecast system (GEFF)","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2013/7707-assessment-global-fire-assimilation-system-gfasv1.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Assessment of the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1)","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2010/9842-assessment-real-time-fire-emissions-gfasv0-macc.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Assessment of the Real-Time Fire Emissions (GFASv0) by MACC","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2017-790","rel":"cite-as"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-2921-2017","rel":"cite-as"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_atmosphere_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/"}],"stac_extensions":["https://stac-extensions.github.io/scientific/v1.0.0/schema.json"],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"CAMS global biomass burning emissions based on fire radiative power (GFAS)","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/cams-global-ghg-reanalysis-egg4/overview_0e58aaaa6c287649388046e898d0a25cfa1a936903e4e71352c365e59dd5dcef.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"dedl:short_description":"This dataset is part of the ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis focusing on long-lived greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).","description":"This dataset is part of the ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis focusing on long-lived greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).

RF is a useful predictor of globally-averaged temperature change, especially when rapid adjustments of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles are taken into account. RF has therefore become a quantitative metric to compare the potential climate response to different perturbations. Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations over the industrial era exerted a positive RF, causing a gain of energy in the climate system. In contrast, concurrent changes in atmospheric aerosol concentrations are thought to exert a negative RF leading to a loss of energy.\nProducts are quantified both in “all-sky” conditions, meaning that the radiative effects of clouds are included in the radiative transfer calculations, and in “clear-sky” conditions, which are computed by excluding clouds in the radiative transfer calculations.\nThe upgrade from version 1.5 to 2 consists of an extension of the period by 2017-2018, the addition of an \"effective radiative forcing\" product and new ways to calculate the pre-industrial reference state for aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei.

Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\nThe assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The atmosphere model allows for estimates at locations where data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The provision of estimates at each grid point around the globe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.\nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates.

Such information has been used in particular as part of the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Ground-based and satellite remote-sensing observations provide a means to quantifying the net fluxes between the land and ocean on the one hand and the atmosphere on the other hand. This is done through a process called atmospheric inversion, which uses transport models of the atmosphere to link the observed concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the net fluxes at the Earth's surface. By correctly modelling the winds, vertical diffusion, and convection in the global atmosphere, the observed concentrations of the greenhouse gases are used to infer the surface fluxes for the last few decades. For CH4 and N2O, the flux inversions account also for the chemical loss of these greenhouse gases. The net fluxes include contributions from the natural biosphere (e.g., vegetation, wetlands) as well anthropogenic contributions (e.g., fossil fuel emissions, rice fields).\nThe data sets for the three species are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency. This is reflected by the different version numbers. In addition, fluxes for methane are available based on surface air samples only or based on a combination of surface air samples and satellite observations (reflected by an 's' in the version number).","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1979-01-01T00:00:00Z","2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GREENHOUSE_GAS_FLUXES","keywords":["Greenhouse gas","Reanalysis","Emissions and surface fluxes","airPollution","Global","Atmospheric conditions","Atmosphere (composition)","Past"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/greenhouse-gases-supplementary-products","rel":"describedby","title":"CAMS Greenhouse Gas Fluxes Documentation"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/supplementary-services#c21ece9c-9469-4605-bcb1-2831778d052b","rel":"describedby","title":"Evaluation and quality assurance (EQA) reports"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GREENHOUSE_GAS_FLUXES","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GREENHOUSE_GAS_FLUXES"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GREENHOUSE_GAS_FLUXES/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_atmosphere_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"CAMS global inversion-optimised greenhouse gas fluxes and concentrations","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/cams-solar-radiation-timeseries/overview_51b05dc9c04479bfe717483ad887ef69461fc77410257222a19775cf68790cce.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"dedl:short_description":"The CAMS solar radiation services provide historical values (2004 to present) of global (GHI), direct (BHI) and diffuse (DHI) solar irradiation, as well as direct normal irradiation (BNI).","description":"The CAMS solar radiation services provide historical values (2004 to present) of global (GHI), direct (BHI) and diffuse (DHI) solar irradiation, as well as direct normal irradiation (BNI).

Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring Greenhouse Gas (GHG), but one whose abundance has been increased substantially above its pre-industrial value of some 280 ppm by human activities, primarily because of emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation and other land-use change. The annual cycle (especially in the northern hemisphere) is primarily due to seasonal uptake and release of atmospheric CO2 by terrestrial vegetation.\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and/or infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from carbon dioxide and other constituent gasses can be identified. It is through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged carbon dioxide abundance in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\nThe software used to analyse the absorption lines and determine the carbon dioxide concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is referred to as the retrieval algorithm. For this dataset, carbon dioxide abundances have been determined by applying several algorithms to different satellite \ninstruments. Typically, different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses and therefore, which product to use for a given application typically depends on the application.\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios of CO2, denoted XCO2 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CO2 columns.  The XCO2 products have been retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT, TANSO-FTS/GOSAT and OCO-2. The mid-tropospheric CO2 product has been retrieved from the IASI instruments on-board the Metop satellite series and from AIRS. \nThe XCO2 products are available as Level 2 (L2) products (satellite orbit tracks) and as Level 3 (L3) product (gridded). The L2 products are available as individual sensor products (SCIAMACHY: BESD and WFMD algorithms; GOSAT: OCFP and SRFP algorithms) and as a multi-sensor merged product (EMMA algorithm). The L3 XCO2 product is provided in OBS4MIPS format. \nThe IASI and AIRS products are available as L2 products generated with the NLIS algorithm.\nThis data set is updated on a yearly basis, with each update cycle adding (if required) a new data version for the entire period, up to one year behind real time.\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S with the exception of the SCIAMACHY and AIRS L2 products that were generated in the framework of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI).\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nColumn-average dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2), Mid-tropospheric columns of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2002-10-01T00:00:00Z","2022-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT","keywords":["Satellite observations","Global","Atmospheric conditions","Atmosphere (composition)","Past"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_climate_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"Carbon dioxide data from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations","type":"Collection"},{"description":"","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[[null,null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.DERIVED_GRIDDED_GLACIER_MASS_CHANGE","license":"","links":[{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.DERIVED_GRIDDED_GLACIER_MASS_CHANGE","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.DERIVED_GRIDDED_GLACIER_MASS_CHANGE"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.DERIVED_GRIDDED_GLACIER_MASS_CHANGE/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"copernicus_climate_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://s3.central.data.destination-earth.eu/swift/v1/dedl-public/collections/climate-dt-min.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"cube:dimensions":{"lat":{"axis":"y","description":"latitude","extent":[-90,90],"type":"spatial"},"lon":{"axis":"x","description":"longitude","extent":[-180,180],"type":"spatial"},"time":{"extent":["2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","2025-07-01T00:00:00Z"],"step":"P0Y0M0DT1H0M0S","type":"temporal"}},"cube:variables":{"100_metre_U_wind_component":{"attrs":{"long_name":"100 metre U wind component","parameter_ID":228246,"product_type":"forecast","shortName":"100u","standard_name":"100_metre_U_wind_component"},"description":"This parameter is the eastward component of the 100 m wind.

Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.\nAn uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble\nat three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.\nSuch uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which\nhas evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.\nTo facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,\nthough monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread. ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified. The data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.\nIt is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access.\nIt should satisfy the requirements for most common applications. An overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article .\nInformation on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines . Data has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for\nthe uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).\nThere are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).

ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. ERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'. The ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower. ERA5-land parameter fields can currently be used in combination with the uncertainty of the equivalent ERA5 fields. The temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or drought forecasting. The temporal and spatial resolution of this dataset, the period covered in time, as well as the fixed grid used for the data distribution at any period enables decisions makers, businesses and individuals to access and use more accurate information on land states.\n\nMain Variables:[['Name'\t'Full_Name'\t'ShortName'\t'Units'\t'Description'\t'url']\n ['10m u-component of wind'\t'10m U wind over land'\t'~'\t'm.s⁻¹'\n  'Eastward component of the 10m wind.

This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\n\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days (monthly means are available around the 6th of each month). In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. So far this has only been the case for the month September 2021, while it will also be the case for October, November and December 2021. For months prior to September 2021 the final release has always been equal to ERA5T, and the goal is to align the two again after December 2021.\n\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days (monthly means are available around the 6th of each month). In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.\n\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1940-01-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS","keywords":["Reanalysis","Copernicus C3S","Global","Atmospheric conditions","Atmosphere (upper air)","Atmosphere (surface)","Past"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_climate_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"ERA5 monthly averaged data on pressure levels from 1940 to present","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-glaciers-extent/overview_a947fbd2fbb24a95d90de559bb4f3b726bc6f819f147434a162b23c9232d91b3.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"dedl:short_description":"A glacier is defined as a perennial mass of ice, and possibly firn and snow, originating on the land surface from the recrystallization of snow or other forms of solid precipitation and showing evidence of past or present flow.","description":"A glacier is defined as a perennial mass of ice, and possibly firn and snow, originating on the land surface from the recrystallization of snow or other forms of solid precipitation and showing evidence of past or present flow.

Methane is a naturally occurring Greenhouse Gas (GHG), but one whose abundance has been increased substantially above its pre-industrial value of some 720 ppb by human activities, primarily because of agricultural emissions (e.g., rice production, ruminants) and fossil fuel production and use. A clear annual cycle is largely due to seasonal wetland emissions.\nAtmospheric methane abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from methane and constituent gasses can be identified. It is through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged methane abundance in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\nThe software used to analyse the absorption lines and determine the methane concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is referred to as the retrieval algorithm. For this dataset, methane abundances have been determined by applying several algorithms to different satellite instruments.\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios of CH4, denoted XCH4 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CH4 columns. \nThe XCH4 products have been retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO-FTS/GOSAT. The mid-tropospheric CH4 product has been retrieved from the IASI instruments onboard the Metop satellite series. The XCH4 products are available as Level 2 (L2) products (satellite orbit tracks) and as Level 3 (L3) product (gridded). The L2 products are available as individual sensor products (SCIAMACHY: WFMD and IMAP algorithms; GOSAT: OCFP, OCPR, SRFP and SRPR algorithms) and as a multi-sensor merged product (EMMA algorithm). The L3 XCH4 product is provided in OBS4MIPS format. The IASI products are available as L2 products generated with the NLIS algorithm.\nThis data set is updated on a yearly basis, with each update cycle adding (if required) a new data version for the entire period, up to one year behind real time.\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S with the exception of the SCIAMACHY L2 products that were generated in the framework of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI).\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nColumn-average dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric methane (XCH4), Mid-tropospheric columns of atmospheric methane (CH4)","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2002-10-01T00:00:00Z","2018-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.METHANE_DATA_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT","keywords":["Satellite observations","Global","Atmospheric conditions","Atmosphere (composition)","Past"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.METHANE_DATA_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.METHANE_DATA_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.METHANE_DATA_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_climate_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"Methane data from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-era5-single-levels/overview_c37c9fd3b18a36a2c656bb4541d37c3bb8a08d2d9ef6708227b87cb47e90a873.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"dedl:short_description":"ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades.

The provision of\nestimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format,\nmakes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.\nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system\ncan resolve data holes, the much sparser observational networks, e.g. in 1960s,\nwill have an impact on the quality of analyses leading to less accurate estimates.\nThe improvement over global reanalysis products comes with the higher horizontal resolution\nthat allows incorporating more regional details (e.g. topography). Moreover, it enables\nthe system even to use more observations at places with dense observation networks.\n\nMain Variables:[['Name'\t'Full_Name'\t'ShortName'\t'Units'\t'Description'\t'url']\n ['10m wind direction'\t'10 metre wind direction'\t'dwi'\t'degrees'\n  'Wind direction valid for a grid cell at the  height of 10m above the surface.

This is different from a weather forecast, which gives a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales. This is one of the reasons long-range forecasts of atmospheric conditions have large uncertainties. To quantify such uncertainties, long-range forecasts use ensembles, and meaningful forecast products reflect a distributions of outcomes.\nGiven the complex, non-linear interactions between the individual components of the Earth system, the best tools for long-range forecasting are climate models which include as many of the key components of the system and possible; typically, such models include representations of the atmosphere, ocean and land surface. These models are initialised with data describing the state of the system at the starting point of the forecast, and used to predict the evolution of this state in time.\nWhile uncertainties coming from imperfect knowledge of the initial conditions of the components of the Earth system can be described with the use of ensembles, uncertainty arising from approximations made in the models are very much dependent on the choice of model. A convenient way to quantify the effect of these approximations is to combine outputs from several models, independently developed, initialised and operated.\nTo this effect, the C3S provides a multi-system seasonal forecast service, where data produced by state-of-the-art seasonal forecast systems developed, implemented and operated at forecast centres in several European countries is collected, processed and combined to enable user-relevant applications.

The rise in global mean sea level in recent decades has been one of the most important and well-known consequences of climate warming, putting a large fraction of the world population and economic infrastructure at greater risk of flooding. However, changes in the global average sea level mask regional variations that can be one order of magnitude larger. Therefore, it is essential to measure changes in sea level over the world's oceans as accurately as possible.\nSea level anomaly is defined as the height of water over the mean sea surface in a given time and region. In this dataset sea level anomalies are computed with respect to a twenty-year mean reference period (1993-2012) using up-to-date altimeter standards.\nIn the past, the altimeter sea level datasets were distributed on the CNES AVISO altimetry portal until their production was taken over by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) in 2015 and 2016 respectively.\nThe sea level dataset provided here by C3S is climate-oriented, that is, dedicated to the monitoring of the long-term evolution of sea level and the analysis of the ocean/climate indicators, both requiring a homogeneous and stable sea level record. To achieve this, a steady two-satellite merged constellation is used at all time steps in the production system: one satellite serves as reference and ensures the long-term stability of the data record; the other satellite (which varies across the record) is used to improve accuracy, sample mesoscale processes and provide coverage at high latitudes. The C3S sea level dataset is used to produce Ocean Monitoring Indicators (e.g. global and regional mean sea level evolution), available in the CMEMS catalogue.\nThe CMEMS sea level dataset has a more operational focus as it is dedicated to the retrieval of mesoscale signals in the context of ocean modeling and analysis of the ocean circulation on a global or regional scale. Such applications require the most accurate sea level estimates at each time step with the best spatial sampling of the ocean with all satellites available, with less emphasis on long-term stability and homogeneity.\nThis dataset is updated three times a year with a delay of about 5 months relative to present time. This delay is mainly due to the timeliness of the input data, the centred processing temporal window and the validation process. However, these processing and validation steps are essential to enhance the stability and accuracy of the sea level products and make them suitable for climate applications.\nThis dataset includes estimates of sea level anomaly and absolute dynamic topography together with the corresponding geostrophic velocities, which provide an approximation of the ocean surface currents. More details about these variables, the sea level retrieval algorithms, additional filters, optimisation procedures, and the error estimation can be found in the documentation.","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1993-01-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.SEA_LEVEL_DAILY_GRIDDED_DATA_FOR_GLOBAL_OCEAN_1993_PRESENT","keywords":["Satellite observations","Ocean (physics)","Copernicus C3S","Global","Oceanographic geographical features","Past"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.SEA_LEVEL_DAILY_GRIDDED_DATA_FOR_GLOBAL_OCEAN_1993_PRESENT","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.SEA_LEVEL_DAILY_GRIDDED_DATA_FOR_GLOBAL_OCEAN_1993_PRESENT"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.SEA_LEVEL_DAILY_GRIDDED_DATA_FOR_GLOBAL_OCEAN_1993_PRESENT/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_climate_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"Sea level gridded data from satellite observations for the global ocean from 1993 to present","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-hydrology-meteorology-derived-projections/overview_72f393f9e80fd90903d8939f892afe274688171891d02412472034e802f340da.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"dedl:short_description":"This dataset provides precipitation and near surface air temperature for Europe as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and as a set of Climate Impact Indicators (CIIs) based on the ECVs.","description":"This dataset provides precipitation and near surface air temperature for Europe as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and as a set of Climate Impact Indicators (CIIs) based on the ECVs. \nECV datasets provide the empirical evidence needed to understand the current climate and predict future changes. \nCIIs contain condensed climate information which facilitate relatively quick and efficient subsequent analysis. Therefore, CIIs make climate information accessible to application focussed users within a sector.\nThe ECVs and CIIs provided here were derived within the water management sectoral information service to address questions specific to the water sector. However, the products are provided in a generic form and are relevant for a range of sectors, for example agriculture and energy. The data represent the current state-of-the-art in Europe for regional climate modelling and indicator production. Data from eight model simulations included in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) were used to calculate a total of two ECVs and five CIIs at a spatial resolution of 0.11° x 0.11° and 5km x 5km. The ECV data meet the technical specification set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), as such they are provided on a daily time step. They are bias adjusted using the EFAS gridded observations as a reference dataset. Note these are model output data, not observation data as is the general case for ECVs. The CIIs are provided as mean values over a 30-year time period. For the reference period (1971-2000) data is provided as absolute values, for the future periods the data is provided as absolute values and as the relative or absolute change from the reference period.

The global warming is calculated from the global climate model (GCM) used, therefore the actual time period of the degree scenarios will be different for each GCM.

This product includes 3-hourly instantaneous fields of integrated wave parameters from the total spectrum (significant height, period, direction, Stokes drift,...etc), as well as the following partitions: the wind wave, the primary and secondary swell waves.\n \nThe global wave system of Météo-France is based on the wave model MFWAM which is a third generation wave model. MFWAM uses the computing code ECWAM-IFS-38R2 with a dissipation terms developed by Ardhuin et al. (2010). The model MFWAM was upgraded on november 2014 thanks to improvements obtained from the european research project « my wave » (Janssen et al. 2014). The model mean bathymetry is generated by using 2-minute gridded global topography data ETOPO2/NOAA. Native model grid is irregular with decreasing distance in the latitudinal direction close to the poles. At the equator the distance in the latitudinal direction is more or less fixed with grid size 1/10°. The operational model MFWAM is driven by 6-hourly analysis and 3-hourly forecasted winds from the IFS-ECMWF atmospheric system. The wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0.035 Hz to 0.58 Hz. The model MFWAM uses the assimilation of altimeters with a time step of 6 hours. The global wave system provides analysis 4 times a day, and a forecast of 10 days at 0:00 UTC. The wave model MFWAM uses the partitioning to split the swell spectrum in primary and secondary swells.\n\n**DOI (product):**   \nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00017\n\n**References:**\n\n* F.

These reanalyses are built to be as close as possible to the observations (i.e. realistic) and in agreement with the model physics The multi-model ensemble approach allows uncertainties or error bars in the ocean state to be estimated.\n\nThe ensemble mean may even provide for certain regions and/or periods a more reliable estimate than any individual reanalysis product.\n\nThe four reanalyses, used to create the ensemble, covering “altimetric era” period (starting from 1st of January 1993) during which altimeter altimetry data observations are available:\n * GLORYS2V4 from Mercator Ocean (Fr);\n * ORAS5 from ECMWF;\n * GloSea5 from Met Office (UK);\n * and C-GLORSv7 from CMCC (It);\n \nThese four products provided four different time series of global ocean simulations 3D monthly estimates.

This product also bears the name of WAVERYS within the GLO-HR MFC. for correspondence to other global multi-year products like GLORYS. BIORYS. etc. The core of WAVERYS is based on the MFWAM model. a third generation wave model that calculates the wave spectrum. i.e. the distribution of sea state energy in frequency and direction on a 1/5° irregular grid. Average wave quantities derived from this wave spectrum. such as the SWH (significant wave height) or the average wave period. are delivered on a regular 1/5° grid with a 3h time step. The wave spectrum is discretized into 30 frequencies obtained from a geometric sequence of first member 0.035 Hz and a reason 7.5. WAVERYS takes into account oceanic currents from the GLORYS12 physical ocean reanalysis and assimilates significant wave height observed from historical altimetry missions and directional wave spectra from Sentinel 1 SAR from 2017 onwards.   \n\n**DOI (product):**\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00022","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-89.80000305175781,179.8000030517578,89.80000305175781]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1993-01-01T00:00:00Z","2024-01-31T21:00:00Z"]]}},"id":"EO.MO.DAT.GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_WAV_001_032","keywords":["sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-x-velocity","sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-from-direction","sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-mean-period","sea-surface-wind-wave-from-direction","sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-inverse-frequency-moment","weather-climate-and-seasonal-forecasting","sea-surface-wave-period-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum","sea-surface-wind-wave-mean-period","sea-surface-wind-wave-significant-height","multi-year","sea-floor-depth-below-geoid","oceanographic-geographical-features","invariant","sea-surface-wave-stokes-drift-y-velocity","sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-significant-height","marine-safety","sea-surface-wave-from-direction-at-variance-spectral-density-maximum","sea-surface-wave-from-direction","coastal-marine-environment","numerical-model","sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-mean-period","sea-surface-wave-significant-height","sea-surface-secondary-swell-wave-significant-height","marine-resources","level-4","sea-surface-wave-mean-period-from-variance-spectral-density-second-frequency-moment","sea-surface-primary-swell-wave-from-direction","global-ocean"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://marine.copernicus.eu/user-corner/service-commitments-and-licence","rel":"license","title":"Copernicus Marine Service Commitments and Licence","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00022","rel":"cite-as","title":"10.48670/moi-00022","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_WAV_001_032","rel":"alternative","title":"Product page","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://catalogue.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/PUM/CMEMS-GLO-PUM-001-032.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Product User Manual","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://catalogue.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-GLO-QUID-001-032.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Quality Information Document","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://catalogue.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/SQO/CMEMS-GLO-SQO-001-032.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Synthesis Quality Overview","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.MO.DAT.GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_WAV_001_032","rel":"self","title":"EO.MO.DAT.GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_WAV_001_032"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.MO.DAT.GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_WAV_001_032/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"Mercator Océan International","roles":["producer"]},{"name":"Copernicus Marine Service","roles":["processor"],"url":"https://marine.copernicus.eu"},{"name":"cop_marine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://marine.copernicus.eu/"}],"stac_extensions":["https://stac-extensions.github.io/scientific/v1.0.0/schema.json"],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"Global Ocean Waves Reanalysis","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://mdl-metadata.s3.waw3-1.cloudferro.com/metadata/thumbnails/INSITU_GLO_PHY_TS_OA_MY_013_052.jpg","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"Global Ocean- Delayed Mode gridded CORA- In-situ Observations objective analysis in Delayed Mode thumbnail","type":"image/jpeg"}},"description":"Global Ocean- Gridded objective analysis fields of temperature and salinity using profiles from the reprocessed in-situ global product CORA (INSITU_GLO_TS_REP_OBSERVATIONS_013_001_b) using the ISAS software.

Only valid data are included, based on a rigorous editing combining various criteria such as quality flags (surface flag, presence of ice) and thresholds on parameter values. Such thresholds are applied on parameters linked to significant wave height determination from retracking (e.g. SWH, sigma0, range, off nadir angle…). All the missions are homogenized with respect to a reference mission (Jason-3 until April 2022, Sentinel-6A afterwards) and calibrated on in-situ buoy measurements. Finally, an along-track filter is applied to reduce the measurement noise.\n\nAs a support of information to the significant wave height, wind speed measured by the altimeters is also processed and included in the files. Wind speed values are provided by upstream products (L2) for each mission and are based on different algorithms. Only valid data are included and all the missions are homogenized with respect to the reference mission.\n\nThis product is processed by the WAVE-TAC multi-mission altimeter data processing system. It serves in near-real time the main operational oceanography and climate forecasting centers in Europe and worldwide. It processes operational data (OGDR and NRT, produced in near-real-time) from the following altimeter missions: Sentinel-6A, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B, Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, CFOSAT ; and interim data (IGDR, 1 to 2 days delay) from Hai Yang-2B mission.\n\nOne file containing valid SWH is produced for each mission and for a 3-hour time window.

dataset covers the indicator for monitoring progress towards renewable energy targets of the Europe 2020 strategy implemented by Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The annual data collection covers in principle all Member States of the European Union. Time series starts in the year 2004.The calculation is based on data collected in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 on energy statistics and complemented by specific supplementary data transmitted by national administrations to Eurostat.In some countries the statistical systems are not yet fully developed to meet all requirements of Directive 2009/28/EC, in particular with respect to ambient heat captured from the environment by heat pumps.This is indicator is a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). It has been chosen for the assessment of the progress towards the objectives and targets of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy.
