The aim is to fulfil the needs of European and national policy development and the requirements of both commercial and public downstream services, e.g. for planning, monitoring, efficiency improvements and the integration of solar energy systems into energy supply grids.\nFor clear-sky conditions, an irradiation time series is provided for any location in the world using information on aerosol, ozone and water vapour from the CAMS global forecasting system. Other properties, such as ground albedo and ground elevation, are also taken into account. Similar time series are available for cloudy (or \"all sky\") conditions but, since the high-resolution cloud information is directly inferred from satellite observations, these are currently only available inside the field-of-view of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite, which is roughly Europe, Africa, the Atlantic Ocean and the Middle East.\nData is offered in both ASCII and netCDF format. Additionally, an ASCII \"expert mode\" format can be selected which contains in addition to the irradiation, all the input data used in their calculation (aerosol optical properties, water vapour concentration, etc). This additional information is only meaningful in the time frame at which the calculation is performed and so is only available at 1-minute time steps in universal time (UT).","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2004-02-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES","keywords":["Satellite image area","Atmospheric conditions","Analysis","Solar radiation","Past","Global","Radiation","airPollution"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/api/v2/terms/static/licence-to-use-copernicus-products.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products"},{"href":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-solar-radiation-timeseries?tab=overview","rel":"cite-as","title":"CAMS solar radiation time-series"},{"href":"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/jOLjDw","rel":"describedby","title":"CAMS solar radiation time-series: data documentation"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/supplementary-services#fa6856b7-a306-4cc4-9137-f3e0cb703093","rel":"describedby","title":"Evaluation and quality assurance (EQA) reports"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.1127/metz/2022/1132","rel":"cite-as","title":"Surface solar irradiation retrieval from MSG/SEVIRI based on APOLLO Next Generation and HELIOSAT‑4 methods"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.1127/metz/2016/0781","rel":"cite-as","title":"Fast radiative transfer parameterisation for assessing the surface solar irradiance: The Heliosat‑4 method"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/","rel":"root"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES/items","rel":"items","title":"items"}],"providers":[{"name":"European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"},{"name":"copernicus_atmosphere_data_store","roles":["host"],"url":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/"},{"name":"wekeo","roles":["host"],"url":"https://www.wekeo.eu/"}],"stac_extensions":["https://stac-extensions.github.io/scientific/v1.0.0/schema.json"],"stac_version":"1.0.0","title":"CAMS solar radiation time-series","type":"Collection"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-carbon-dioxide/overview_c7da6512e3b4771cca9e37bd5c22213bc650818c85cbe05e034672d32c07aa6b.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"dedl:short_description":"This dataset provides observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) amounts obtained from observations collected by several current and historical satellite instruments.","description":"This dataset provides observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)\namounts obtained from observations collected by several current and historical \nsatellite instruments. Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring Greenhouse Gas (GHG), but one whose abundance has been increased substantially above its pre-industrial value of some 280 ppm by human activities, primarily because of emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation and other land-use change. The annual cycle (especially in the northern hemisphere) is primarily due to seasonal uptake and release of atmospheric CO2 by terrestrial vegetation.\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and/or infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from carbon dioxide and other constituent gasses can be identified. It is through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged carbon dioxide abundance in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\nThe software used to analyse the absorption lines and determine the carbon dioxide concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is referred to as the retrieval algorithm. For this dataset, carbon dioxide abundances have been determined by applying several algorithms to different satellite \ninstruments. Typically, different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses and therefore, which product to use for a given application typically depends on the application.\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios of CO2, denoted XCO2 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CO2 columns.
